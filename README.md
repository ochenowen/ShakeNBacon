# Shake-n-Bacon
###Introduction to Word Frequency Analysis
A world famous UW history professor wants me to settle a very old debate on who wrote Shakespeare's plays, Shakespeare or Sir Francis Bacon? You protest that this question is surely outside my area of expertise. "Oh, no," chuckles the historian, stroking his snowy white beard. "I need a Computer Scientist! Someone who can efficiently compare any two documents in terms of their word frequency."

Authors tend to use some words more often than others. For example, Shakespeare used "thou" more often than Bacon. The professor believes a "signature" can be found for each author, based on frequencies of words found in the author's works, and that this signature should be consistent across the works of a particular author but vary greatly between authors.

The professor gave me copies of Shakespeare's writing (Hamlet) and Bacon's writing (The New Atlantis) to anaylsis.
